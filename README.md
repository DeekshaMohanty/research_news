Here are the steps to add new articles:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Write your article in a json file and add it to the articles directory. (Here is a sample file https://github.com/tardis-sn/research_news/blob/main/sample/sample_article.json)
3. The images should be added to the images directory. The path for all images in your json should start with "../articles/**name of image with extension**"
4. Once, you have added all the material, run the validate.ipynb to verify that your article matches the defined schema.
5. After the validation is successful, open a PR and request a review.
